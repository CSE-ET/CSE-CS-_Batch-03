# 🛡️ Web Vulnerability Scanner (GUI Based)

A Python-based Web Vulnerability Scanner with a Tkinter GUI that detects common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Open Redirect, and Directory Traversal.

This tool also demonstrates advanced conceptual modules like:
- VBE (Vulnerability Benchmark Evaluation)
- RSMSE (Risk Sensitive Mode Switching Engine)
- HSE (Hybrid Scanner Engine)
